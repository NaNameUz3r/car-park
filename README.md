### Car park service

This is a learning project from the skillsmart coding school.

#### Current state:

Poor proof of concept of a multi-user (management) service with CRUD for multi-models implementing a kind of car-park for contractor companies.

We can CRUD Vehicles, and fetch their rides with geotracks and some reports.

####

Check this out with fixture dump:

```
docker-compose up
```
And log in with "admin2" username, and "qwerty" password.
There is, actually admin1 with same password. Explore :D
